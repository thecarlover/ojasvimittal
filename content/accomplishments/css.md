# Introduction

This is a certificate of completion for the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) course on Hackerrank. This course covers the basics of CSS, including selectors, properties, and values. It also covers more advanced topics such as flexbox, grid, and animations. I completed this course to improve my CSS skills and learn new techniques for styling web pages.
