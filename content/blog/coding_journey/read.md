# My Start of Coding Journey

In the digital age, where technology intertwines with every facet of our lives, my journey into the realm of coding began with a humble desktop computer gifted to me in the third grade. Initially, it served as a portal to endless hours of gaming and mindless internet surfing. Little did I know, within its metallic confines lay the seeds of a passion that would shape my future.

One fateful day, driven by curiosity, I embarked on the daring mission of opening the CPU. However, my adventure was cut short, leaving the task incomplete. Another memorable incident involved an unexpected encounter with water during a gaming session, which tragically resulted in the demise of my beloved PC. Despite these setbacks, my fascination with computers only deepened.

Each visit to the computer shop ignited a spark within me as I marveled at the intricate hardware and software technologies on display. With each passing day, my curiosity grew, fueled by the rapid advancements in technology that surrounded me.

It wasn't until I reached the eleventh grade that my path took a significant turn. It was then that I was introduced to the captivating world of coding and programming as part of my computer science curriculum. Under the guidance of my teacher, Miss Harpreet Ma'am, I embarked on my first coding adventure with Python.

Miss Harpreet Ma'am, with her expertise and patience, became my beacon in the vast sea of coding languages and concepts. Her guidance not only imparted technical knowledge but also instilled in me a sense of confidence and curiosity to explore further.

While my father had been my first teacher in the realm of technology, it was Miss Harpreet Ma'am who unlocked the doors to the enchanting world of coding. Her mentorship sparked a flame within me that continues to burn brightly to this day.

As I look back on my journey from gaming enthusiast to aspiring programmer, I am filled with gratitude for the experiences and individuals who have shaped my path. Each stumble and setback has been a stepping stone, guiding me closer to realizing my passion for coding.

Today, armed with determination and a thirst for knowledge, I stand at the threshold of endless possibilities in the world of technology. My journey has only just begun, but I am eager to embrace the challenges and discoveries that lie ahead as I continue to code my way through life.

# How I choose Bachelor's in Computer Science

When it came time to choose what I wanted to study in college, I found myself faced with a big decision. After thinking it over, I realized that I was really interested in computers and how they work. From a young age, I loved playing around with computers and learning about how they functioned. As I got older, I started to get more serious about learning about technology.

I decided to study Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) because I saw a lot of potential in it. In today's world, there's a huge need for people who understand computers and can use them to solve problems. Whether it's creating new software or coming up with innovative ideas, CSE seemed like a field where I could make a real difference.

What I liked most about CSE was that it's always changing. There's always something new to learn, whether it's a new programming language or a new way to use technology. I've always enjoyed solving problems, so the idea of being able to use my skills to tackle real-world issues was really exciting to me.

Of course, choosing CSE wasn't easy. I knew it would be challenging, with lots of hard work and long hours of studying. But I also knew that it would be worth it in the end, because I would be doing something I truly loved.

As I start my journey in college, I'm excited to see where it takes me. I know there will be ups and downs along the way, but I'm ready to face them head-on. With each step I take, I'm getting closer to achieving my dreams in the world of computer science and engineering.

Choosing CSE wasn't just about picking a major—it was about following my passion, pursuing my interests, and making a difference in the world. And that's something I'm truly excited about.

# The Therapeutic Power of My Laptop: A Love-Hate Relationship


In the hustle and bustle of everyday life, amidst the chaos and clamor of the world, there exists a sanctuary—a refuge where I find solace, comfort, and perhaps, a touch of madness. This sanctuary comes in the form of a humble device, a companion in both joy and sorrow: my laptop.

My relationship with my laptop is a complex one, filled with equal parts love and frustration. It serves as my portal to the digital realm, a gateway to endless possibilities and boundless creativity. Yet, it also harbors my weaknesses, tempting me with its siren song of distraction and procrastination.

There are days when my laptop is my greatest ally, a trusted confidant in times of need. It is my canvas, where I paint my thoughts and dreams with pixels and keystrokes. Whether I'm writing a heartfelt letter to a friend, crafting a piece of code, or immersing myself in a captivating story, my laptop is there, a faithful companion in the journey of self-expression.

But there are also days when my laptop becomes my greatest adversary, a relentless temptress luring me away from the tasks at hand. It is a black hole of endless distractions, beckoning me with the promise of mindless scrolling and infinite cat videos. In those moments of weakness, I find myself ensnared in its grip, unable to break free from its hypnotic allure.

And yet, despite its flaws, I cannot deny the therapeutic power that my laptop holds over me. In moments of stress or anxiety, it offers a welcome escape—a chance to lose myself in the vast expanse of the internet or lose track of time in the embrace of a captivating game.

But perhaps, what makes my laptop truly therapeutic is its ability to connect me with others. In a world where physical distance often separates us, my laptop bridges the gap, allowing me to stay connected with friends and loved ones across the globe. Whether it's a late-night chat with a friend halfway across the world or a virtual game night with loved ones, my laptop brings us together, fostering a sense of closeness and belonging in an increasingly fragmented world.

In the end, my laptop is more than just a device—it is a lifeline, a source of comfort and connection in an ever-changing world. It is my weakness, yes, but it is also my strength—a beacon of light in the darkness, guiding me through the twists and turns of life's journey.

So here's to my laptop, my trusted companion in this crazy adventure called life. May it continue to serve as a source of therapy, inspiration, and endless possibility for years to come.
